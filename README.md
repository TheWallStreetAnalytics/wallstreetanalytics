# Addressing moderator posts from reddit:
After our conversation with a WSB moderator and seeing his response on reddit, we believe there may have been some miscommunication. We ARE NOT planning on selling out to some "angel investor" or anything. There has been one conversation that has occurred between us and said investor, and we are currently unsure what he would want out of it. It was merely intended to be mentioned in passing to illustrate the potential this idea has gathered within hours of its conception.

Anything that goes against our vision statement, goals, or ideals of leveling the playing field will NOT be tolerated. To address the "it's happening whether you help or not", that was first brought up by the reddit moderator (in different terms) and we were all in agreement. Someone, somewhere, is going to do this regardless of WSB's support. Do we want it to be us, who we know have good intentions, or the other people?

# WallStreet Analytics
An endeavor to create an analytics tool to democratize the information hedge funds are creating teams to collect.

## Vision Statement

On February 18th, in the "Virtual Hearing - Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide," congressional hearing, it became evident that hedge funds have already started investing exorbitant amounts of resources into data mining and analysis on stock trends in social media.

While these organizations have a significant financial advantage over average retail investors that allow them to make more educated decisions, we the people have the manpower, the expertise, and the determination to provide this same information to everyone. We will collaboratively collect and publicly disseminate the same information that hedge funds are paying for with the goal of leveling the playing field for the average retail investor.
