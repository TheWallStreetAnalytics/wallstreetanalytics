# Anything else I should know?

Yes! This repo is set up to use the most recent version of React, React v17. Additionally it uses webpack 5 and babel for its production build. This is literally bleeding edge front end technology here! 

# but what about IE 11?

first, shut up. We hate IE 11 and if you use it you should upgrade. But with that said, yes, we support IE 11 but only so much as babel supports it. we don't support it with styles or more advanced visualization tools. Its not the 1800s anymore, you need to upgrade.
